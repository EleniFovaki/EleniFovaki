 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a large scale ERP/CRM system for billing the energy sector in Greece ([Protergia.gr](https://www.protergia.gr/) is using it) and experimenting with javascript libraries such as React.js and node.js. </br>
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Docker and machine learning basics.</br>
 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently interested in full stack web development and cloud technologies.</br>
