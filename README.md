## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Eleni Fovaki and I am a software engineer from Athens, Greece. 
<!--
**EleniFovaki/EleniFovaki** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a large scale ERP/CRM system for billing the energy sector in Greece ([Protergia.gr](https://www.protergia.gr/) is using it) and experimenting with javascript libraries such as React.js and node.js. </br>
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and machine learning basics.</br>
 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on energy market projects.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about if I am currently available for collaboration via my Linkdn page.</br>
ðŸ“« How to reach me: Via mail: fovakieleni@gmail.com and my Linkdn page: https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenifovaki055/</br>
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her</br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I don't like gaming that much (I know I know!), but I do enjoy reading, sports, music concerts and swimming in the sumertime. Also I try to make Tik Toks to inspire fellow girl programmers!
